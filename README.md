we were provided with the map we go the google -my map we drews the boundaries for the maps for each stake. Then we embedded the map we created on the google colab file. The files app.py and logs.txt were downloaded and further uploaded in github repo. In next step, we used streamlit app to create an app by connecting it with github. Later we copy the app link and pasted in the repo.
